This repository contains the Antora components for the Hazelcast Management Center documentation.

The documentation source files are marked up with AsciiDoc.

== Docs Structure

This section describes some important information about how this repository is structured:

- The component name, version, and start page are configured in each branch's `antora.yml` file.
- The navigation for all modules is stored in the ROOT module's `nav.adoc` file.
- The {url-playbook}[docs site playbook] instructs Antora to automatically build the site using content in the `main` branch as well as any tags that are prefixed with *v*.

== Release Workflow

Documentation for new releases is hosted in versioned tags that are prefixed with `v`. For example, content for the `4.2020.12` version is hosted in the `v4.2020.12` tag. The `latest-dev` content is stored in the `main` branch

The documentation build process is triggered whenever you push a new tag to this repository or commit to the `main` branch.

=== Patch Releases

This section guides you through the steps for releasing documentation for patch releases.

. When you are ready to release, create a new release branch from the `main` branch and name it with the full version number that you are releasing. For example, if you are releasing version 4.2020.12, name the branch 4.2020.12.
+
TIP: For guidance on writing content, see the {url-contribute}[contribution guidelines].

. In the `antora.yml` file of your release branch, update the `version` field with the version of Management Center that you are working on.
+
[source,yaml]
----
version: 4.2020.12
----

. Tag the latest commit in your release branch with a `v` followed by the version number.

. If you have made any changes since creating your release branch, merge those changes back into the `main` branch.

. Delete your release branch.

. If you are releasing a new latest version, in the `develop` branch of the `hazelcast/hazelcast-docs` repository, submit a pull request to update the `_redirects` file with your release version of Management Center.
+
NOTE: This file is where we alias the `latest` path in URLs.
+
[source,bash]
----
# Redirect latest management center alias to the latest version
/management-center/latest/*  /management-center/4.2020.12/:splat 200!
----

The documentation site will now be built, including content from your tagged version.

== Major and Minor  Releases

This section guides you through the steps for releasing documentation for major and minor releases.

. When you are ready to release, create a new release branch from the `main` branch and name it with the full version number that you are releasing. For example, if you are releasing version 4.2021.02, name the branch 4.2021.02.
+
TIP: For guidance on writing content, see the {url-contribute}[contribution guidelines].

. In the `antora.yml` file of your release branch, update the `version` field with the version of Management Center that you are working on.
+
[source,yaml]
----
version: 4.2021.02
----

. Tag the latest commit in your release branch with a `v` followed by the version number.

. If you have made any changes since creating your release branch, merge those changes back into the `main` branch.

. Delete your release branch.

. If you are releasing a new `latest-dev` version, in the `antora.yml` file of the `main` branch, increment the `version` field to the `latest-dev` version. For example, `4.2021.02-SNAPSHOT` becomes `4.2021.03-SNAPSHOT`.

. In the `develop` branch of the `hazelcast/management-center-docs` repository, submit a pull request to update the `_redirects` file with the new versions of Management Center.
+
NOTE: This file is where we alias the `latest-dev` and `latest` paths in URLs.
+
[source,bash]
----
# Redirect latest management center alias to the latest version
/management-center/latest/*  /management-center/4.2021.02/:splat 200!
# Redirect latest-dev management center alias to the latest-dev version
/management-center/latest-dev/*  /management-center/4.2021.03-SNAPSHOT/:splat 200!
----

The documentation site will now be built, including content from your tagged version.
