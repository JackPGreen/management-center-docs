[[high_availability]]

Multiple Management Center instances can connect to the same cluster to ensure availability and eliminate a single
point of failure for management and monitoring purposes.

NOTE: Multiple Management Center instances are independent and don't form a cluster.

This has the following implications:

 . It's up to the user to maintain consistent configurations on all Management Center instances. Only Client Filtering
configuration is synchronized among Management Center instances.
 . Inconsistencies in reported metrics are possible, for instance if one of the instances goes down for some time.
 . Every Management Center instance has its own HTTP session. Load balancing options are limited to:
 * sticky session;
 * round-robin with Basic Auth;

== Client Filtering Synchronization
Client filtering configuration for a cluster is synchronized among all Management Center instances connected to the
cluster. The synchronization happens on *deploy* action (**Deploy Changes** button). It is in line with the general
client filtering modifications, where *lists modification* and *deploy* are separate actions.

NOTE: "deploy" action on MC1 overrides the client filtering configuration including the not yet deployed changes
for this cluster on MC2 and vice versa.

When Management Center connects to a cluster that already has some client filtering configuration
deployed, then Management Center saves the client filtering configuration from the cluster to the local persistent storage. The
previous configuration stored in Management Center is overwritten.

When another Management Center instance deploys a new client filtering configuration, then a message "Client filtering
configuration was updated by another Management Center instance" is displayed and blocks "Client Filter Settings" and
"Client Filter Lists" are automatically refreshed.
