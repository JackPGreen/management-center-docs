NOTE: For new and improved features in Hazelcast Platform 5.5, see xref:{page-latest-supported-hazelcast}@hazelcast:ROOT:whats-new.adoc[What's new in Hazelcast Platform 5.5].

With enhanced monitoring and an improved console experience, these improvements are designed to elevate your cluster management experience.

== Vector Collections (BETA)

**Vector Collections** support a specialized type of vector, which is optimized for storing, searching, and managing vector embeddings along with additional metadata. This feature allows you to include metadata values for filtering, processing and detailed analysis of vectors. 

Management Center 5.5 has additional screens for Vector Collections' metrics. For more information see xref:data-structures:vector-collection.adoc[`Vector Collections`]

== Multi-version Rolling Upgrades

Hazelcast Platform 5.5 introduces Long-term Support (LTS) releases to simplify your upgrade experience and give you greater control over when and how you upgrade your software.  It is now possible to upgrade from Hazelcast 5.2.x or later to 5.5 in a single upgrade.

Management Center 5.5 has been updated to support this multi-version Rolling Upgrade. For more information, see xref:clusters:triggering-rolling-upgrade.adoc[`Triggering a Rolling Upgrade`]

== Multi-member routing for Java clients

Platform 5.5 adds an additional client routing option for Java client applications connecting to geographically dispersed clusters.  Management Center has been updated to support this new Multi-member client routing.

== Multi-resource User Code Namespaces

Platform 5.4 added Namespaces which provide a container for Java classpath resouces.  Management Center has enhanced its support for User Code Namespaces including support more than five namespaces.
For further information see xref:clusters:namespaces.adoc[`User Code Namespaces`]

== Support for Log4j2 Json Template logging

Hazelcast Plaform has supported JSON Templates for logging purposes and now this functionality has been added to Management Center. For further information see xref:deploy-manage:logging.adoc[`Logging`]

== Additional Improvements and fixes

* **Demote a data member to a lite member** can now be done directly within Management Center.

* **Client Filtering Preview** is now available to see the affects of the Client Filtering actions before they are made live.  For further information see xref:clusters:client-filtering.adoc#client-filtering-preview[`Client Filtering preview`]

* **Limit Client Filtering modes** can now be defined using a system property to limit the available modes in Client Filtering.  See `hazelcast.mc.clientFiltering.modes`

* **Improvements in the WAN Replication table** to improve its readability.  It is now possible to configure the `consistency-check-strategy` during the dynamic creation of a WAN publisher within Management Center.  The dropdown fields now support long values without impacting the UI.

* **Config Healthcheck** warning icon in the left menu has been updated to reflect the colour of the highest severity issue detected.

* **Slow Operations** improvements have been made to help identify potential problems.

* **OIDC configuration parameters** can now be included when defining the security provider settings.

* **SQL Browser** no longer redirects back to the Dashboard screen when closed.  Now it returns to the previous page shown.

NOTE: in Clustered REST API `memberConnection` allowed field values have been changed from `ALL` | `<member-address>` to
`ALL_MEMBERS` | `MULTI_MEMBER` | `SINGLE_MEMBER`

NOTE: Hazelcast Management Center 5.4 requires Java 17 or later.
